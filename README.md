# Balatro Transaction Confirmations

A Balatro mod for handhelds that adds confirmation dialogs to all card purchases and sales, helping prevent accidental transactions.
Ya, the repo name should be updated, but ehhh. Doesn't work with mouse/keyboard/touchscreen I don't think.

## Features

- **Confirmation dialogs** for all card purchases and sales. "Sell", "Buy" and "Open"
- **Safe Default** first option is "Go Back" to help mitigate accidental clicks

- **PLEASE NOTE** mouse/keyboard/touchscreen IS NOT supported, since I use a handheld. It might work, it might not.

### Prerequisites
- **Balatro** (base game)
- **[Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)** v1.0.0 or higher

### Install Steps
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sabu5000/balatro-shop-confirmations/releases)
2. Extract the mod files
3. Copy the mod folder to your Steamodded mods directory:
4. Launch Balatro and check that the mod is enabled in the Mods menu

## How It Works

### Before (without mod):
- Click "Buy" and the Item is purchased immediately
- Click "Sell" and the Card is sold immediately
- Stuck with any accidents

### After (with mod):
1. Click "Buy" or "Sell" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears with:
   - **Go Back** (blue, default) - Cancels the action
   - **Continue** (green) - Proceeds with transaction
3. Use Joysticks to select
4. Press confirmation button

### Mod not working?
1. Ensure Steamodded is installed and working
2. Check that the mod is enabled in Balatro's Mods menu
3. Verify the mod files are in the correct directory
4. Look for error messages in the Steamodded log

As noted above, this mod might not work with mouse/keyboards

### Missing confirmation for some transactions?
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Sabu5000/balatro-shop-confirmations/issues) with details about which transaction type isn't covered. Realistically I can't promise I'll fix it but I might!! and it'd be cool to know :|
